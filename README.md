# Lab08-Library

Generic collection example with add, remove, and enum properties.

## Sumamry

This is our first implementation of generic collections.  Using a library for an example, we are generating a collection list of books that are stored in our "library".  In order to do this we created a concrete book class that, when instantiated, generates a book object that we can then add to our library.  Built out properly, our library will allow the user to either view our selection of books, "checkout" a book, which allows them to put the book into a book bag generic collection, or return a book, removing said book from their book bag and adding it back to our library.

Coming soon!

## Step by Step

The user will be given six options in the console:

1. View our library collection
2. Add a book to the library collection
3. Borrow a book \(removing from library and adding it to the book bag collection\)
4. Return a book \(remove from book bag and add back to the library\)
5. View the book bag collection
6. Exit the console.
